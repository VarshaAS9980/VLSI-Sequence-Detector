# SEQUENCE DETECTOR  
This project implements a VLSI-based sequence detector for recognizing specific binary patterns in a serial input stream. Designed using hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL, it employs finite state machines (FSM) for efficient sequence detection. The system includes modules for state transitions, output generation, and clock synchronization. It supports customizable patterns, making it adaptable for various applications like data communication and error detection. The project is ideal for learning digital design concepts, FSM implementation, and VLSI design flow. Simulation results and testbench files are included for verification. Contributions and suggestions for enhancements are welcome to expand its capabilities further.
